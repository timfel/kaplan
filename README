This is a precompiled version of Kaplan. It comes with its own version of Scala
(2.9.0.1), so the only dependencies are Java (6+) and Bash.

To compile a source file, run

    $ scalac-kaplan src.scala

To simplify problems related to multiple classpaths, all classes are generated
in a centralized "classes" directory.

To run a program, use

    $ scala-kaplan MainObject

...where MainObject is a Scala object that defines a "main" method. Do not
worry about the classpath; the directory with all generated classes is included
automatically.

As an example, you can try:

    $ scalac-kaplan PaperExamples.scala
    $ scala-kaplan PaperExamples
